    - text: "Chopin’s body may have been buried in France, but his heart, surgically removed at the time of his death, remains in his homeland, Poland. After leaving Warsaw in his youth, Chopin would never return to Poland, and he maintained connections with his family and Polish roots with the only tool he had in that time - letters. As a result he lived the rest of his life a product of the Great Emigration (1831-1970) of Polish political elites and intelligentsia, exiled after what had been Poland was divided among Russia, Austria, and Prussia." 
    - text: "Chopin’s placement as an composer writing (perhaps not authentic, but certainly nationally evocative) Polish music at a time when there was no physical Poland is significant. That Chopin’s compositions are not simply regurgitations of Polish national music tropes, but undeniably idiosyncratic in their free flowing nature, makes his music compelling. The pieces that he wrote were well-loved during their time, especially as a Polish lifeline for those who could not return home. Love for Chopin’s music endures today, as Polish and global audiences continue to appreciate the ways that his music speaks to them on both personal and social levels."
